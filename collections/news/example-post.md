Russia's foreign ministry said Moscow has the right to a tit-for-tat response to the second wave of sanctions imposed by the EU over its annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea.

## Heading 2

The EU imposed an new set of sanctions on Friday, adding 12 Russians and Crimeans to a list of people targeted by EU asset freezes and travel bans. There are now 33 on the list.

### Heading 3

"It's a pity that the European council made a decision that is divorced from reality," the ministry's spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said on Saturday.

"We believe it is time to return to the platform of pragmatic co-operation that reflects the interests of our countries.

"However, of course, the Russian side reserves itself the right to give a comparable answer to the actions taken."
